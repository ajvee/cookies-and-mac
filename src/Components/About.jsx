Hi! I’m Linn. I am a graduate of The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY with a degree in Culinary Arts. I also studied Baking and Pastry at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley, California. I have worked in many restaurants over the years and most recently as Executive Chef of a private event space in New York City  where I lost all of my staff due to the pandemic and had to teach myself how to create all different types of desserts and pastries, one of them being macarons.

I soon found myself becoming obsessed with these little gems. Spending night after night, creating batch after batch and spending hours compiling lists of new flavors and ideas for improving and “upping” my “macaron game”. Being a self-taught macaron baker, I used my knowledge and skills acquired from culinary school, along with my years of experience in the restaurant industry to create delicious and innovative flavor combinations, using the finest and freshest restaurant worthy ingredients. 


What had originally began as mere curiosity, sparked into an immense love and understanding for these little pastries. So much so, that I felt it was my duty to create my own macaron business to share the splendor of macarons with everyone! Come see what sets us apart from the other guys, with small personal batches where you can taste the love in each bite. 


Enjoy!

Linn K. Johansen
